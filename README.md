# tinkerforge-ws
This project implements the Tinkerforge weatherstation from the [kit](https://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Kits/WeatherStation/WeatherStation.html).


I have an older version of the kit, which means i have deprecated Bricklets.
The project is aimed to support all versions of the Bricklets but as I'm not able to test newer versions it might be buggy for those versions.
