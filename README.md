# tinkerforge-ws

This project implements the Tinkerforge weatherstation from the [kit](https://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Kits/WeatherStation/WeatherStation.html).

I have an older version of the kit, which means i have deprecated Bricklets.
The project is aimed to support all versions of the Bricklets but as I'm not able to test newer versions it might be buggy for those versions.

npm install
